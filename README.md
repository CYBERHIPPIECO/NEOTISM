# NEOTISM - Interactive 3D-Printed Neuromancer Stopmotion
Neotism is an interactive Neuromancer-inspired stop-motion animation. Every element of the game is made from 3D-printed resin made interactive. Game follows the story of a rogue.

**Notes:**
Noema - meaning "thought" or "what is thought about".
Did you mean noetism? Neotism fits better with the language of the futura.
A insubstantial nightmare, appearing real in biblical proportion while trying to wake up but appears that you have, but have not.
Person 1: I just had an neotic dream. 
Person 2: How do you know you're awake then?
